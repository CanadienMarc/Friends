Rachel gets her first pay check but is angry that most of her money went to FICA, and also gets a visit from her old friends, which depresses her further about her new life.

Rachel reveals she's never done laundry before but Ross helps her stand up to a woman and Ross gets his first kiss with Rachel. Joey wants to go out with his ex-girlfriend (Angela) who now has a boyfriend (Bob), so he arranges for Monica and him to double-date with them by leading Monica to believe that Angela and Bob are siblings and therefore Angela's actual boyfriend is Monica's date.

However, when she picks up another he learns that it's not all it's cracked up to be and can't take it. Joey gets picked up at the musical by the 'Estelle Leonard Talent Agency,' which finally gets him a film role as a stand-in for Al Pacino's butt double. However, he loses the job because he overacts.
